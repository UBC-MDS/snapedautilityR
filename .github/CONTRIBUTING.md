# Contributing to snapedautilityR

This outlines how to propose a change to snapedautilityR. 
For more detailed info about contributing to this, and other tidyverse packages, please see the
[**development contributing guide**](https://rstd.io/tidy-contrib). 

## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at: https://github.com/UBC-MDS/snapedautilityR/issues

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help
wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

You can never have enough documentation! Please feel free to contribute to any
part of the documentation, such as the official docs, docstrings, or even 
on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/UBC-MDS/snapedautilityR/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

### Pull request process

*   Fork the package and clone onto your computer. If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github("UBC-MDS/snapedautilityR", fork = TRUE)`.

*   Install all development dependences with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. 
    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. 
*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init("brief-description-of-change")`.

*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.
    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.
    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.

*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>.

### Code style

*   New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). 
    You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  

*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  

*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. 
   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.
