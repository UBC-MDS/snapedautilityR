snapedautilityR is an open-source library that generate useful function to kickstart EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) with just a few lines of code. The system is built around quickly analyzing the whole dataset and providing a detailed report with visualization. Its goal is to help quick analysis of feature characteristics, detecting outliers from the observations and other such data characterization tasks.

## Features

1.  `plot_histograms`: Plots the distribution for numerical, categorical and text features
2.  `detect_outliers`: Generate a violin plot that indicates the outliers that deviate from other observations on data.
3.  `plot_corr`: Generates Correlation Plots for numerical (Pearson's correlation), categorical (uncertainty coefficient) and categorical-numerical (correlation ratio) datatypes seamlessly for all data types.

## Installation

You can install the released version of snapedautilityR from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("snapedautilityR")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/snapedautilityR")
```

## Usage (TBC)

```{r example}
library(snapedautilityR)
## basic example code
```

## Similar Work

We recognize EDA (exploratory data analysis) and preprocessing packages are common in the Python open source ecosystem. Our package aims to do a few things very well, and be light weight. A non exhaustive list of EDA helper packages in Python include:

-   [`dlookr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dlookr/index.html)

    -   This package includes handful tools to diagnose, explore and transform the data.

-   [`DataExplorer`](https://rdocumentation.org/packages/DataExplorer/versions/0.8.2)

    -   This package provides an easy to generate report, visualization and feature engineering functions for data analysis/predictive modeling.
